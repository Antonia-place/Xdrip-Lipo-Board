I made an enclosure, however it still has to be improoved. To further reduce space, the JST-2 connector is not used in this design. In the future I might add one with JST-2 support. The battery compartment should fit an [850mah Lipo Battery](http://www.ebay.com/itm/3-7V-850mAh-703040-Lipo-Polymer-li-ion-Battery-for-cell-phone-Camera-DVD-GPS-PAD-/121844114909?hash=item1c5e79a5dd:g:LCwAAOSwUdlWdSaa) (7x30x40mm). 
I printed the parts on www.3dhubs.com for around 5â‚¬ shipped. The material used was PLA, but ABS is probably better.
Here are some pictures of the current progress:
