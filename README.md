# Xdrip-Lipo-Board
Xdrip on a printed circuit board!

You can order the PCB directly here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/IuYnoGB9

# Features

- The board uses a MAX1811 battery charging ic
- Both Xbridge & Xdrip circuit support, selectable via a switch
- Battery can be soldered directly on the PCB or via a JST-2 connector
- Charging Status LED

# Components:

- 3x 1206 SMD Resitors (150Ω, 10kΩ, 27kΩ)
- 2x 1206 SMD Capacitor 10μf
- 2x micro switch MSK-12C02
- 1x 1206 Red LED (any led should work)
- 1x micro usb socket (ebay id: 121829362799)
- 1x MAX1811 lithium charger IC
- 1x JST-2 connector (optional)
- 1x HM-11 Bluetooth V4.0 Transceiver BLE Module (i got the one from fasttech)
- 1x Polulu Wixel
- 1x LiPo/Li-ion Battery

Attention! The MAX1811 Charger IC is set to 500mah. Only use a battery with more than 500mah.

# PCB Assembly

Everything is labeled on the PCB. The components are large enough to be soldered by hand, the trickiest for me was the micro usb socket. But if you use a hot air rework station (40$ on ebay) it should be very easy.
